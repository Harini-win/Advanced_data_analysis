# Automated Data Analysis and Visualization Leveraging GPT-4o-Mini for Advanced Insights

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the development of an advanced Python-based system engineered to automate data analysis, visualization, and insight narration from any given dataset. By harnessing the capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) in conjunction with state-of-the-art data processing and visualization techniques, the system produces comprehensive Markdown reports enhanced with high-quality visual representations. Designed for versatility, it ensures compatibility with a wide range of CSV datasets, catering to diverse analytical requirements.

## Key Features
### 1. Comprehensive Automated Analysis
- Performs detailed summary statistics, identifies missing values, and detects anomalies with precision.
- Conducts sophisticated correlation studies and clustering analyses to reveal latent patterns in data.
- Utilizes the LLM to provide advanced insights, suggest novel analytical techniques, and recommend methodological improvements.

### 2. Dynamic Visualization Generation
- Automatically generates 1–3 visually appealing charts in PNG format tailored to the dataset.
- Leverages a diverse array of visualizations, including heatmaps and bar charts, to suit the dataset’s attributes and analytical outcomes.

### 3. Narrative and Insight Generation
- Engages the LLM to craft detailed narratives encompassing dataset descriptions, analysis methodologies, significant findings, and their broader implications.
- Produces a cohesive Markdown report (`README.md`) integrating narratives with visual elements for seamless comprehension.

### 4. Efficient LLM Resource Utilization
- Reduces reliance on direct dataset transfers by preprocessing and summarizing data before querying the LLM.
- Optimizes token consumption while ensuring analytical depth and precision.

### 5. Universal CSV Dataset Compatibility
- Adapts dynamically to datasets of varying column types, distributions, and complexities, ensuring robust and scalable performance.

### 6. Self-Contained and Independent Execution
- Operates as a standalone script (`autolysis.py`) requiring no external dependencies beyond standard Python libraries.

### 7. Ease of Use and Integration
- Simplifies execution via the `uv` CLI tool with a single command for end-to-end functionality:
  ```bash
  uv run autolysis.py dataset.csv
  ```

## Workflow
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Reads the input CSV file to extract metadata such as column names, data types, and sample values.
- Identifies missing data points, anomalies, and potential outliers for further scrutiny.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Executes a comprehensive suite of exploratory analyses, including:
  - Statistical summaries for all variables.
  - Correlation matrices to evaluate inter-variable relationships.
  - Anomaly and outlier detection.
  - Clustering to group data points with similar traits.

### 3. Seamless LLM Integration
- Transmits dataset metadata and EDA results to GPT-4o-Mini for enriched insights.
- Incorporates advanced Python code suggestions or supplementary analyses into the workflow.

### 4. Visualization Creation
- Generates high-quality visualizations using libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Stores charts as PNG files in the working directory for easy access and integration.

### 5. Narrative Report Generation
- Employs the LLM to create a structured Markdown report encompassing:
  - Dataset overview.
  - Methodology and analysis techniques.
  - Key findings and implications.
  - Embedded visualizations to enhance the narrative.

### 6. Output Files
- Produces the following deliverables:
  - `README.md`: A detailed Markdown report integrating analysis results and visualizations.
  - `*.png`: A series of PNG files containing the visualizations.

## Sample Datasets
The system has been rigorously tested with:
1. **goodreads.csv:** 10,000 books from GoodReads, detailing genres, ratings, and metadata.
2. **happiness.csv:** Global data from the World Happiness Report, highlighting happiness indices and contributing factors.
3. **media.csv:** Faculty evaluations of movies, TV series, and books, blending subjective ratings with objective data.

## Usage Instructions
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Configure the required environment variable for authentication:
   ```bash
   export AIPROXY_TOKEN=your-token-here
   ```
3. Execute the script via the `uv` CLI tool:
   ```bash
   uv run autolysis.py dataset.csv
   ```
4. Access the output files in the working directory:
   - `README.md`: The main analysis report.
   - `*.png`: PNG files containing visualizations.

## Technical Notes
- **Optimized LLM Utilization:**
  - Employs multiple queries to the LLM for detailed analyses and visualization recommendations.
  - Integrates OpenAI’s function-calling API for enhanced precision.

- **Environment Configuration:**
  - Requires the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable for LLM authentication.

- **Visualization Tools:**
  - Utilizes Seaborn and Matplotlib to create compelling and insightful visualizations.

## Deliverables
1. **Core Python Script:**
   - `autolysis.py`: A standalone script encapsulating all functionalities.
2. **Generated Output Files:**
   - Separate directories for each dataset (e.g., `goodreads/`, `happiness/`, `media/`) containing:
     - `README.md`: The comprehensive Markdown report.
     - `*.png`: Visualization files in PNG format.
